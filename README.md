Instructions:

This project was written in C/C++ and is meant to be run in a UNIX-style
command line terminal that supports GCC, Makefiles, and command-line arguments.

1) Type "make" in a terminal window in the folder that contains the code to
  compile the programs.

2) First, run the receiver program by typing "./recv" after compiling.

3) Then, open another terminal in the same directory.  Now, in this second
  terminal, type "./sender <FILENAME>" which <FILENAME> is the name of the
  file to read and send.  The file used for testing was "msg.txt".

4) The two programs will synchronously transfer the data from the input file
  to the output file, which is always called "recvfile".

5) To break out of the programs in the terminal, press "CTRL-C".

6) To remove compiled object files, type "make clean" in the directory
  containing the files.
